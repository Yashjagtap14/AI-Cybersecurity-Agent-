A AI-powered cybersecurity agent that analyzes the security of any website or social media profile link (Instagram, YouTube, etc.).

This agent checks for common vulnerabilities, assigns a security score out of 10, and provides actionable recommendations to protect your digital identity from cyberattacks.


🚀 Features

* 🌐 Accepts links to websites or social media (Instagram, YouTube, etc.)
* 🛡️ Performs cybersecurity checks such as:

  * HTTPS (SSL/TLS) validation
  * Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
* 📊 Returns a security score (1–10)
* 🤖 Works like an AI security assistant suggesting improvements
* ⚡ Lightweight & easy to set up



🔧 How It Works

1. **Input** – paste your link.
2. **Analyzer** – fetches response data & headers.
3. **AI Scoring Engine** – evaluates against cybersecurity best practices.
4. **Output** – returns security score + suggestions.


🔮 Future Enhancements

* ✅ SSL certificate expiry checks
* ✅ Malware & reputation scanning (VirusTotal API)
* ✅ Styled HTML dashboard for reports
* ✅ Deeper AI-powered vulnerability scanning



💡 This project demonstrates how AI agents can be applied in cybersecurity automation, making it easier for anyone to test and secure their online presence.
